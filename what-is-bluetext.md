# What is Bluetext?

Bluetext extends the Polytope MCP server to streamline enterprise proof-of-concept development. It handles sandboxed code execution, dynamically manages LLM context, and structures components according to best practices — all while keeping engineers in direct control of the development process. This allows teams to build and iterate on application features without manual infrastructure setup or context management overhead, focusing purely on logic and collaboration with AI agents. No magic. Just predictable workflow.

Built on Polytope, Bluetext leverages container-based architecture that supports Docker and Kubernetes (with additional container types coming soon). This approach enables optimised deployment across all environments while eliminating common development pain points like system dependencies, programming language versioning conflicts, and virtual environment management. These issues are even more pronounced in team-based environments — and Bluetext’s use of Polytope directly solves them
