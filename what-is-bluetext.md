# What is Bluetext?

Bluetext extends the Polytope MCP server to streamline enterprise proof-of-concept development. It handles sandboxed code execution, dynamically manages LLM context, and structures components according to best practices â€” all while keeping engineers in direct control of the development process. This allows teams to build and iterate on application features without manual infrastructure setup or context management overhead, focusing purely on logic and collaboration with AI agents. No magic, just momentum.

Built on Polytope, Bluetext leverages container-based architecture that supports Docker and Kubernetes. Bluetext makes it easy for all developers - including robots - to run, test, and thus iterate on their applications. Bluetext solves issues that are especially pronounced in team-based environments, by managing relevant context through the Polytope MCP server.
