# What is Bluetext?

Bluetext is a development tool which will help you to create enterprise grade distributed systems faster and better. Bluetext extends the Polytope MCP server to streamline proof-of-concept development. It handles sandboxed code execution, and structures components according to best practices — all while keeping engineers in direct control of the development process. This allows teams to build and iterate on application features without manual infrastructure setup or context management overhead, focusing purely on logic and collaboration with AI agents. No magic, just momentum.

Bluetext provides templates for scaffolding and integrating full stack applications — this includes frontends, API's, databases, and workflow orchestration services. These templates encode best practices for how these technologies should work together, e.g. database session management, service communication patterns, and error handling. The templates eliminate the trial-and-error phase of connecting distributed system components.&#x20;
