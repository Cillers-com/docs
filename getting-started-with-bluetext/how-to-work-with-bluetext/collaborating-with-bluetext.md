# Collaborating With Bluetext

When using Bluetext in a team environment, we recommend starting by creating a basic app on one machine. Scaffold and implement the required services, then make this your initial commit. Once that’s done, other team members can clone the repository to begin contributing.

You can then use Git to coordinate work—for example, one team member might handle the frontend while others focus on the database or API.

To keep collaboration smooth, make small, frequent commits and regularly pull updates from the main branch. This minimizes merge conflicts and keeps changes easy to manage. A good practice is to pull the latest code and commit your updates after finishing a task or switching contexts in your coding agent. If you’re clearing your context, that’s also a great time to sync with the repository and resolve any conflicts.
