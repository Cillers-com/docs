# Overview

The Cillers platform makes it super easy for developers to add functionality in ways that are aligned with Cillers' opinionated services, structure and tooling. But, Cillers is also super flexible and enables developers to add pretty much any functionality in any way they like, but they will then have less "for free".&#x20;

This section on how to build your system on Cillers is therefore structured in two main parts:&#x20;

* [Cillers Core](cillers-core/): How to add functionality using Cillers' opinionated services, structure and tooling.
* [Cillers Flex](cillers-flex.md): How to add functionality that is outside of the current scope of Cillers opinionated services, structure and tooling.&#x20;
