# Quick Start Guide

The code for the React web frontend and the Strawberry GraphQL API is stored under the `code/web-app` and `code/app-api` directories. These directories are mounted into the Docker containers that run them. And, they are hot reloaded, so any saved change is immediately reflected in the web app and API.
