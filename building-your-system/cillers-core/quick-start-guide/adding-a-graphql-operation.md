# Adding A GraphQL Operation

In GraphQL, there are three types of operations: queries, mutations and subscriptions. Queries are used to fetch data and are similar to GET requests in RESTful APIs. Mutations change data, akin to POST, PUT, or DELETE actions in REST, allowing clients to insert, update, or delete data. Subscriptions provide a way to maintain real-time data flow, enabling clients to receive updates as they happen, which is particularly useful for dynamic user interfaces where data needs to reflect changes as they occur.
