# Scalability, Reliability And Cost-Effectiveness

The primary challenge in scaling an enterprise-grade software system and making it reliable ,without losing your shirt, is often related to data storage and retrieval. Hence, we have focused our attention on figuring out which data technologies are easiest to scale and make reliable in a cost-effective way.&#x20;

We have selected Couchbase for active data, because it is typically used to save engineering organizations that face these challenges. Couchbase is used to power many of the world's most critical software systems, such as most credit card transactions, logins, bookings, billings, taxis, social media posts, space flights etc.&#x20;

We have selected Redpanda for event streaming data and data integrations because it is much easier to scale and make reliable in a cost-effective way than Kafka and other Kafka-based services. Redpanda is a Kafka drop-in replacement written in C++, which means that it doesn't suffer from the inefficiencies of Java, most notably deplays in event processing caused by garbage-collection. Redpanda is gaining momentum and is used in an increasing number of the world's most critical systems, such as NYSE, Vodaphone and Cisco.

When it comes to big data, Databricks has little competition.  &#x20;
