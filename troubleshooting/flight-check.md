# Flight Check

Before you start prompting, there are a few checks you can do to test that the Polytope and the Bluetext repository are set up correctly. First, to see if your agent is connected to the polytope MCP server, you can simply ask your coding agent: "do you have access to the Polytope MCP server?".&#x20;

After this, you can ask "which Bluetext tools are available to you?" if you see tools like add-api, add-frontend etc, Bluetext is successfully configured! if you only see tools like describe-container and describe-job, you have not configured the Bluetext repo in the polytope.yml file correctly.
