# Getting Started

To start using Cillers Coder, you'll need to install an API key which you can obtain by contacting Cillers at hello@cillers.com. Once you have your key, run `cillers set-api-key` and paste in the provided key when prompted. The key is stored in `~/.cillers/api_key.txt` and will be used across all your projects, so you only need to set it once.

We're excited for you to experience the power of Cillers Coder in crafting your software systems. If you have any questions along the way, our team is here to help. Happy coding!
