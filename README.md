# Introduction

Bluetext is a development tool that enables you to build better enterprise-grade distributed systems faster. With Bluetext you can build a solid foundation for your distributed system in a few minutes, fulfilling the most demanding enterprise-grade requirements, including scalability, performance, security, compliance, flexibility and cost-effectiveness. A foundation that is structured in a way that will enable you to add a lot of business logic with high velocity.&#x20;

Bluetext is for building enterprise-grade distributed systems what Ruby on Rails is for building web applications. Just like Ruby on Rails is opinionated about structure and technology choices for web apps, Bluetext is opinionated about which technologies to use for each area of capabilities that are needed for building enterprise-grade distributed systems and how to structure such systems. The result is increased predictability, reliability and development velocity. That said, Bluetext is also flexible for accommodating the specific needs of each system.

Bluetext is designed to integrate well with all popular coding agents and LLMs. Bluetext is primarily intended to empower expert developers to develop at AI-speed while remaining in exact control over what gets built. Bluetext's AI-capabilities also makes it easier for new developers to learn how to build enterprise-grade distributed systems.&#x20;

Although Bluetext makes it possible to "vibe-code" enterprise-grade distributed systems, this is not its primary intent. Bluetext is not intended to remove from developers the responsibility to understand the systems they build, but rather to make it easier for them to do so.&#x20;

Bluetext is still in the early development phase. The primary current use-cases for Bluetext are to build demos and PoCs of enterprise-grade systems, trying out relevant game-changing technologies and AI-assisted enterprise software development training.&#x20;

The easiest way to get started with Bluetext is to request a virtual Bluetext Development Machine, which can be done on our website [https://bluetext.io/](https://bluetext.io/) or to install Bluetext on your local machine by following our [getting started guide](getting-started-with-bluetext/getting-started.md). Then you can go through our [hands-on training labs](labs/lab-1-full-stack-hello-world-app.md).&#x20;
