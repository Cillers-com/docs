# Development Velocity

### The Main Objective

The main objective of the Cillers platform is to increase the speed and quality of enterprise-grade software system development.&#x20;

### **The Problem**

Through decades of experience developing a diverse set of software systems and interviewing hundreds of developers, architects and heads of software engineering, we have come to realize that the main obstacle to speed and quality in software development is complexity. This insight was the reason we called the platform Cillers, which is a portmanteau of Complexity and Killers.

Complexity typically creeps into a system over time, one step at a time. When you need to add a new capability to your system, you may need to add a new piece to your infrastructure. When you need to scale up your system and make it more reliability, you typically need to add a lot of complexity. And, then your costs sky-rockets and you add even more complexity to reduce costs. Then, you realize that your security is not really what it needs to be, increasing complexity even further. You end up with a very low development speed and lots of bugs caused by the difficulty to comprehend the end-to-end logic of your system.

### **Our Solution**

The Cillers platform is designed so that a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) built on Cillers can cost-effectively and quickly be scaled up to serve up to 100s of millions of requests per second and meet the highest requirements for reliabilty and security, without much increase in complexity.

Of course, the scalability, reliability, security and cost-effectiveness of a system built on Cillers depends on you following sound data modelling and coding principles, but even if you break those you are much less likely to mess these priorities up on Cillers than on any other system we know of.

Complexity resistance is the cornerstone design priority of the Cillers platform. Our approach is aligned with Einstein's saying, "everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler." Thus, we have mapped out all of the capabilities that most enterprise systems are comprised of and figured out the best way to support them with a minimum of complexity, yet providing easy and cost-effective scalability, reliability and security as well as full flexibility to evolve your system to meet unforeseen needs over time.
