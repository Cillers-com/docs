# Development Velocity

The main objective of the Cillers platform is to increase the speed and quality of enterprise-grade software system development. Through decades of experience developing a diverse set of software systems and interviewing hundreds of developers, architects and heads of software engineering, we have come to realize that the main obstacle to speed and quality in software development is complexity. This insight was the reason we called the platform Cillers, which is a portmanteau of Complexity and Killers.

But, like Einstein said "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler." We have mapped out which capabilities most enterprise systems comprise. And, we have researched which are the world's best software infrastructure technologies that will enable us to support all of those capabilities, while at the same time minimizing the complexity needed to build systems on top of the Cillers platform.&#x20;

Complexity typically creeps into a system over time, one step at a time. When you need to add a new capability to your system, you may need to add a new piece to your infrastructure. When you need to scale up your system and make it more reliability, you typically add a lot of complexity. And, then your costs sky-rockets and you add even more complexity to reduce costs. Then, you realize that your security is not really what it needs to be ... Therefore, the architecture of Cillers is designed to be resistant to complexity creeps.&#x20;

The Cillers platform is designed so that a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) built on Cillers can cost-effectively and quickly be scaled up to serve up to 100s of millions of requests per second and meet the highest requirements for reliabilty and security, without large increases in complexity. Of course, this depends on you following sound data modelling and coding principles.&#x20;

The Cillers platform is also designed so that you can build a MVP just as fast as you can on a much less capable, reliable, secure and cost-effective platform that most developers currently use. (And, soon it will be a cinch to deploy it to production too).
