# Introduction

Bluetext is a development tool that enables you to build better enterprise-grade distributed systems faster. With Bluetext you can build a solid foundation for your distributed system in a few minutes, fulfilling the most demanding enterprise-grade requirements, including scalability, performance, security, compliance, flexibility and cost-effectiveness. A foundation that is structured in a way that will enable you to add a lot of business logic with high velocity.&#x20;

Bluetext is for enterprise-grade distributed systems like Ruby on Rails is for building web applications. Just like Ruby on Rails is opinionated about structure and technology choices for web apps, Bluetext is opinionated about which technologies to use for each area of capabilities that are needed for building enterprise-grade distributed systems and how to structure such systems. The result is increased predictability, reliability and development velocity. That said, Bluetext is also flexible for accommodating the specific needs of each system.

Bluetext is designed to integrate well with all popular coding agents and LLMs, with the objective to enable developers to reliably build enterprise-grade distributed systems at AI-speed.

Bluetext is still in the early development phase. The primary current use-case for Bluetext is to build demos and PoCs of enterprise-grade systems, trying out game-changing enterprise-grade distributed systems technologies and AI-assisted enterprise coding training.&#x20;

The easiest way to get started with Bluetext is to request a virtual Bluetext Development Machine and follow one of the labs in this documentation. You can make that request on [https://bluetext.io/](https://bluetext.io/). Alternatively, you can use our [getting started guide](getting-started-with-bluetext/getting-started.md) to install Bluetext on your local machine.&#x20;
