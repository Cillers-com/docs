If you have a lot of RAM memory (> 16GB) you will be able to run Couchbase and other memory intensive processes on your computer which makes it super easy to get started. If you have less memory we recommend that you run memory heavy services in the cloud, e.g. we have support for connecting your local development stack with Couchbase's cloud service Capella which includes a free tier, but it will take slightly more effort to get started.
