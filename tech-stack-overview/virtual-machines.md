# Virtual Machines

Our development environment runs on Linux-based virtual machines without a graphical desktop environment.

To make development accessible, we installed **VS Code Server**, which allows you to connect to your VM and develop directly from your browser. You’ll find the access link in the email you received.

We also installed **Chromium** on the VM itself. This browser runs _inside_ the server and is used to view and interact with what you develop locally. Since the application is only accessible from within the server environment, the frontend and service UIs must be viewed through a browser running on the VM. This is why you’ll see a “browser in a browser” setup. You can open Chromium using the link provided in the email.

In addition, the VM comes preinstalled with **Polytope**, **Docker**, and a **coding agent**, all of which are prerequisites for developing with Bluetext. Finally, we installed the **Bluetext Extension**, which streamlines and simplifies the overall Bluetext development experience.
