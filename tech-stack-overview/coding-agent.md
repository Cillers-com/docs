# Coding Agent

The coding agent acts as an intermediary between you and a Large Language Model (LLM/AI). Its role is to make requests to the model, interpret the responses, and execute development-related actions.

Common tasks performed by the agent include reading and writing code, executing terminal commands, and interacting with the file system. The agent’s capabilities can be extended through **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers**, which allow additional tools and integrations to be exposed.
