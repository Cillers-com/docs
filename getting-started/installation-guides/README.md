# Installation Guides

The installation procedure differs significantly depending on operating system, so we have separate installation instructions for each operating system.&#x20;

### Installation Guides:

* [For macOS users](for-macos-users.md)
* [For Windows users](for-windows-users.md)
* [For Linux users](for-linux-users.md)

### Trouble Shooting:

Run the Polytope doctor command to see if there are any problems with the basic installation. This command will provide warnings if anything that Polytope depends on is not installed in alignment with their recommendations.

```bash
pt run doctor
```
