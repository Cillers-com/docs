# GraphQL Client

Your GraphQL Client Web UI is located at [http://localhost:11001/](http://localhost:11001/). You should use the same login credentials for this service as you do for the web app, because the main purpose of this service is to help you try out the GraphQL queries that you plan to use in your web app.&#x20;

Try adding an item using the ItemsCreate query. The new item should automatically show up in the web app items view.&#x20;
