# TLDR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

Here is all you typically need to do to get started with Cillers, but you may want to read through the full Getting Started documentation to ensure a smooth experience.&#x20;

```bash
brew update
brew tap polytopelabs/tap
brew install cillers-com/tap/cillers
cillers new my-system
cd my-system
pt run stack
```

Note that Windows users will need to install WSL2 (Windows Subsystem For Linux) first, and run the commands specified above in the Linux environment.&#x20;

And, if you don't have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) installed, you will need to install that first to be able to run the above commands. The documentation includes instructions on how to install Cillers without Homebrew as well.&#x20;
