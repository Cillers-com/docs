# Run Your Cillers System On Your Laptop

**Run the following commands in your terminal:**

```bash
cd my_system
pt run stack
```

This will take a little while the first time (depending on your network speed) as all the components of the stack are downloaded.

Watch to logs to see when the system is up and running. The last thing to come up is usually the web front end and Curity. It will seem that nothing is happening for a few minutes before the front end is finally built.
