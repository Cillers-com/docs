# GraphQL Client

Open insomnia and import the following collection, if you haven't already: [https://cillers-com.github.io/insomnia-cillers-graphql-client/localhost.json](https://cillers-com.github.io/insomnia-cillers-graphql-client/localhost.json)

Send the hello request. Insomnia should open up a Curity web login page for you. Create an account on your local Curity server using this page, if you haven't already. If you have already created an account, you can just log in.&#x20;
