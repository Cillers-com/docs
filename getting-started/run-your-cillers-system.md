# Run Your Cillers System On Your Laptop

**Run the following commands in your terminal:**

```bash
cd my_system
pt run stack
```

This will take a little while the first time (depending on your network speed) as all the components of the stack are downloaded.

Watch the logs to see when the system is up and running. The last thing to come up is usually Curity.
