# Lab 2: Full Stack Clothing Store

## 1. Setup

Before proceeding, make sure you are sitting in a new, empty directory, which we will create our project in. Then, open the Bluetext extension from the activity bar on the left. You will have the option to preform a quick setup which configures your workspace for working with Bluetext and Polytope. Run this quick setup and make sure to select "Cline (Recommended)" when asked which coding agent you want to configure.&#x20;

Now, a polytope.yml file has been created at the root of your directory which exposes polytope to bluetext's tools, and Cline has been configured to connect to Polytopes MCP server.



## 2. API

lets first add the API endpoints.&#x20;
