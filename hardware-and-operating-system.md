# Hardware And Operating System

## RAM Requirements

The components that are included in your Bluetext project will affect the hardware requirements needed. With a minimal configuration you will not need much, but if you're building an enterprise-grade system you would need at least 16GB of RAM and more if you want to run your own AI models.

## Recommended Setup

We donâ€™t recommend using processors released before 2015. For the best experience with Bluetext, use the latest version of macOS on a Mac with an Apple M-series chip. However, Bluetext will run on any system capable of running Polytope.

## Operating System Requirements

Bluetext runs on the latest versions of macOS, Windows and Linux.&#x20;
